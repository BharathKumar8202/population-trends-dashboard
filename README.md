# Population Trends Dashboard Project

## Task 1: Building a Dashboard for Population Trends Analysis by Country Group

**Software Used:** Microsoft Power BI

### Introduction
This project explores global population dynamics through key demographic indicators from 1960 to 2022, with projections for 2023-2050. The goal is to create an interactive, single-screen dashboard that helps policymakers and the public understand population trends. The dashboard aggregates country-level data by regional and income groupings to provide insights into significant population shifts.

### Objective
The primary objective is to uncover trends in developing countries based on region and income level. This includes highlighting key demographic shifts, such as rural versus urban population changes, and identifying countries in transitional development phases. These insights aim to inform global development strategies and help policymakers address socio-economic challenges effectively.

### How to Use
- Open the `Task1.pbix` file in Microsoft Power BI.
- Interact with the dashboard to analyze population trends across different regions and income groupings.
- Hover over various elements like charts and graphs to explore patterns in the data, including urban versus rural population trends and future projections.
